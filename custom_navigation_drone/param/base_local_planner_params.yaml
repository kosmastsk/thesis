# For help regarding the values below, see http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner/Tutorials
#
## This configuration file is very very large. For future reference, the most
## important parameters are:
##
### global_plan_viapoint_sep: keep positive, although, experimentally, it seems
## to be unaffecting the robot's behaviour
##
### min_obstacle_dist:
##
### inflation_dist:
##
### weight_viapoint: the larger the value, the closer to the via points the robot
## will travel. I would say keep weight_viapoint <= 10
##
### enable_homotopy_class_planning: keep false, otherwise the robot gets confused
## as to which path it should choose?

# the magnitude of the 1/control_rate)

# temporal resolution (dt): usually 10% of dt_ref
  dt_hysteresis: 0.1

# Some global planners are not considering the orientation at local subgoals
# between start and global goal, therefore determine it automatically
  global_plan_overwrite_orientation: True

# If true, the underlying trajectories might be initialized with backwards
# motions in case the goal is behind the start within the local costmap
# (this is only recommended if the robot is equipped with rear sensors)
  allow_init_with_backwards_motion: False

# Specify maximum length (cumulative Euclidean distances) of the subset of the
# global plan taken into account for optimization [if 0 or negative: disabled;
# the length is also bounded by the local costmap size]
  max_global_plan_lookahead_dist: 3.0

# Force the planner to reinitialize the trajectory if a previous goal is
# updated with a seperation of more than the specified value in meters

# approximation is used.
  exact_arc_length: False

# Publish planner feedback containing the full trajectory and a list of active
# obstacles (should be enabled only for evaluation or debugging purposes)

## ViaPoints ###################################################################

# Min. separation between each two consecutive via-points extracted from the
# global plan [if negative: disabled].
# The actual value of parameter global_plan_via_point_sep defines the minimum
# separation between two consecutive via-points along the global plan
# (in meters). E.g. by setting the value to 0.5, each 0.5m a new via-point is
# selected from the global plan (as long as the resolution of the global plan
# is sufficient). Hence by adjusting the value you can specify whether a
# coarse or a fine reference path should be taken into account for
# path-following.

# container

# Substitute the rotational velocity in the commanded velocity message by the
# corresponding steering angle (check 'axles_distance')
  cmd_angle_instead_rotvel: False


# The robot is modeled as a simple circle with a given radius
# ~/footprint_model/radius. The distance calculation is similar to the one of the
# point-type robot, but with the exepction, that the robots' radius is added to
# the parameter min_obstacle_dist each function call. You can ged rid of this
# extra addition by chosing a point-type robot and adding the radius to the
# minimum obstacle distance a-priori.

# If false, all obstacles are considered to be static.

# If true, the old association strategy is used (for each obstacle, find the
# nearest TEB pose), otherwise the new one (for each teb pose, find only
# 'relevant' obstacles).
  legacy_obstacle_association: False

# The non-legacy obstacle association technique tries to connect only relevant
# obstacles with the discretized trajectory during optimization, all obstacles

# radius of 2.0*min_obstacle_dist.
  obstacle_association_force_inclusion_factor: 1.5
