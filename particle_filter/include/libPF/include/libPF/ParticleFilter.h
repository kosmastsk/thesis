 * @author Stephan Wirth
 *
 * @brief (Templated) class that defines a particle filter.
 *
 * A particle filter is a descrete method to describe and compute with a probability distribution.
 * In other words, it is an implementation of a recursive Bayesian filter by Monte Carlo Methods.
 * The sequential importance sampling (SIS) used is also known as bootstrap filtering, the
 * condensation algorithm, particle filtering, interacting particle approximations and survival
 * of the fittest.
 * This template class implements the basic methods for a particle filter.
 * The changeable parts of the particle filter are implemented using the strategy pattern. If you
 * don't know what it is, you should read something about it, as it is used in many methods here.
 *
 * The following strategies are used by ParticleFilter, all of them can be switched at runtime.
 * @li ObservationModel defines how a state can be evaluated (weighted)
 * @li MovementModel defines how a state will be propagated during time
 * @li ResamplingStrategy defines how resampling occurs (see ImportanceResampling for the default implementation)
 *
 *
 * You must do the following to use the particle filter:
 * @li Create a class for the state that you want to track with the ParticleFilter.
 *     Let's name your state MyState.  The state has to implement the operator
 *     @code
 *       operator=(const MyState& other);
 *     @endcode
 *     because a particle filter copies the "fittest" states in a resampling step.
 *     If you want to use the methods getBestXPercentEstimate() or getMmseEstimate(),
 *     your state has to implement two more operators:
 *     @code
 *       MyState operator*(float factor) const;
 *     @endcode
 *     and
 *     @code
 *       MyState& operator+=(const MyState& other);
 *     @endcode
 *     These operators allow the ParticleFilter to compute the weighted average
 *     of a set of states.
 *     Instead of creating your own state, you may use a basic datatype as state,
 *     for example to create a <tt>ParticleFilter<float></tt> is perfectly possible.
 * @li The next step is to create an observation strategy DroneObservationModel for your state, deriving
 *     it from ObservationModel<MyState> and implementing the method
 *     ObservationModel::measure().
 * @li Create a movement strategy DroneMovementModel for your state, deriving it from
 *     MovementModel<MyState> and implement the methods MovementModel::diffuse()
 *     and MovementModel::drift().
 *
 * After that you can use the particle filter this way:
 * @code
 *   int numOfParticles = 500;
 *   DroneMovementModel mm;              // create movement strategy
 *   DroneObservationModel om;           // create observation strategy
 *   ParticleFilter<MyState> pf(numOfParticles, &om, &mm); // create filter
 *
 *   // run the filter loop
 *   bool doFilter = true;
 *   while (doFilter) {
 *     // update your observation model here
 *     // ...
 *     // update your movement model here (if necessary)
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // run one filter step, the filter uses the
 *     // observation model and the movement model
 *     // that were given in the constructor
 *     pf->filter();
 *
 *     // retrieve the best state and
 *     // do something with the result
 *     std::cout << pf->getBestState().getVariable1() << std::endl;
 *
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * The ParticleFilter has the following resampling modes:
 * @li RESAMPLE_NEVER skip resampling,
 * @li RESAMPLE_ALWAYS does a resampling in every filter step whenever
 *     filter() is called,
 * @li RESAMPLE_NEFF does a resampling in filter() only if the number of
 *     effective particles falls below the half of the total number of
 *     particles (see getNumEffectiveParticles() for details).
 *
 * The default is RESAMPLE_NEFF.
 * You can switch the mode via setResamplingMode().
 *
 * You have two options to influence the states that are used internally by
 * the particle filter. The first one is to set a prior state:
 * @code
 *   // initialize the filter's states by setting a prior state
 *   MyState priorState;
 *   priorState.setPosition(20, 30);
 *   priorState.setVelocity(1.2, 0);
 *   pf.setPriorState(priorState);
 * @endcode
 * The second option is to use a state distribution that is derived from
 * StateDistribution:
 * @code
 *   // create a distribution
 *   DroneStateDistribution distribution;
 *   // draw all states from this distribution
 *   pf.drawAllFromDistribution(distribution);
 * @endcode
 *
 * To traverse the particle list, you may use particleListBegin() and particleListEnd()
 * which return iterators to the beginning and to the end of the list respectively.
 *
 * @see Particle
 * @see ObservationModel
 * @see MovementModel
 * @see ResamplingStrategy
